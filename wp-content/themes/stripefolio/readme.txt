A free SEO-ready WordPress theme that serves as a readable blog and a full-screen portfolio showcase, with a slick gallery stripe.

== Description ==

Stripefolio is a <strong>free</strong> clean WordPress theme designed to function both as a readable blog and website as well as a fullscreen portfolio showcase for designers, painters, artists, photographers, etc. Have a look at the <a href="http://wpdemo.synved.com/stripefolio/">live demo</a>!

The portfolio gallery is shown in a stripe at the bottom of the page that becomes opaque/visible only when moving the mouse over it. This also causes the website content to nicely and smoothly slide out of view and leave the entire browser view empty for larger versions of the gallery images to show up in an outstanding full screen mode. The theme also features a very clear and highly readable typography to ensure your blog/site stays as accessible as possible, while still providing an appealing and stylish look & feel.
